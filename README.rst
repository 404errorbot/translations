Translations for CodeIgniter 4 System Messages
##############################################

This project contains translations for CodeIgniter 4
localization, eg. **system/Language/en**.

Copy the folder(s) for the locales you are interested in,
from inside the **Language** folder of this project to your
**application/Language** folder.

You may then use the CodeIgniter Language class to reference the translations
directly ... see the `User Guide <https://bcit-ci.github.io/CodeIgniter4/outgoing/localization.html>`_.

Localization in CodeIgniter 4 follows the `ISO 639-1 conventions <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes>`_.

Contributing
************

If you have a translation or correction, please fork the repository, clone it
locally, and then create a new branch (from master)
for each set of related changes or for
a complete language pack. Once your branch is complete, *then* create a pull
request to merge it into the main repository. 

If you are contributing a variant of a main locale (e.g. "en-CA"), you
only need to provide those translations that differ from it.
 
Unlike the framework repository, we are not insisting on GPG-signed
commits here, but please remember to "sign" your commits.

Pull requests to the repository will only be considered if they come from
the maintainer for any translations in the request, or if the maintainer
adds a comment indicating they approve of any changes.
If a maintainer is unresponsive

PR conversations should be conducted in English, thanks.
